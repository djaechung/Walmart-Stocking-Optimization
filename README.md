# Walmart-Stocking-Optimization
This repository contains code for a product stocking presciption algorithm developed for class 15.095, MIT Fall 2022. 

We implement some baseline prescription models, namely sample average approximation (SAA), regress-and-compare, and optimizing over previous store values.
We also implement some more sophisticated models, namely a classification and regression tree (CART) for prescription, and an optimal regression tree (ORT).

Our best prescription model, the ORT, improves week profit by nearly $400K from the SAA baseline, demonstrating the power of optimization in prescriptive contexts.
